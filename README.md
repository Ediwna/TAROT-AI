## Proposal
How nice would it be to know your day before it starts? It can’t always be sunny, but I hope it can be a day for you to prepare an umbrella before it rains. Our project is TAROT AI(타로 아이). Recently, apps like fortune cookies and today’s horoscope on YouTube is on trend. TAROT AI tells you a flow of your day through reading tarot cards. TAROT AI gives Nugu speaker users card options from 1 to 78. And the user selects three of them and tell the cards’ number to Nugu speaker. It is a program that Nugu speaker checks the user's voice recognition and summarizes the interpretation of the tarot cards, selected by the user. Recently, it was reluctant to visit tarot shops because of busy life and COVID-19. Also, online tarot cards which is simply about looking at tarot results can fail to give accuracy and clearness. We can easily see tarot through a simple conversation with Nugu speaker while eating lunch or cleaning the house. Why don't you start your day with TAROT AI? Don't be disappointed if you get a bad result. Your day is what you make.
